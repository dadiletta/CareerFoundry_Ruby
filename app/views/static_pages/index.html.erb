          <h2>Course Goals</h2>
          <p>This course was paid for me by investors in a new platform being built to compete with WordPress. Its aims are to build modular components and themes similar to most major CMS's, but it will have a more powerful, reprogrammable core. My goal is to learn enough RoR to contribute on the backend development.</p>

          <p>Teaching is about empowerment and metacognitive thought. Engaging lessons draw students into challenging academic rigor and endow them with enviable capabilities. While the pursuit of skills opens the door for careers and prepares students to become dutiful citizens, it is the exploration of reason through inquiry and experiential learning that makes for an exceptional pedagogue. Adolescence is marked by the introduction of metacognition, the ability to be aware and critical of one’s own thoughts. Honing this capacity is an awesome and deeply rewarding responsibility. </p>
          <p>Having taught in economically depressed Oakland, California, alongside impressive exemplars of Teach for America, I absorbed teaching practices that have shaped my philosophy. Routines and practiced procedures are essential to bell-to-bell teaching. Students know and can predict the agenda of almost every one of my classes, though the content always changes. Creative, hands-on activities not only increase retention but preempt most classroom management issues. But most of all, I learned to shake students’ hands on the way in to class and to be in close communication with their families —a teacher is so much more than the head of one classroom at the end of a hall.</p>
          <p>The juxtaposition of finding myself the following year teaching on the other side of both the country and the socioeconomic spectrum was a learning experience as well. My private school tenure underlined the merits of authentic assessment, the nearly limitless potential of our students, the proper application of technology, and of course the role of a mentor in students’ lives. Leading high school students to start their own online businesses made practical economic theory a subject that received surprising levels of participation. I shared my personal curiosity with the more complex aspects of Computer Science, and we soon had to find a new textbook as my students raced ahead. And I gave shelter, encouragement and attention to students that felt at times as if they couldn’t keep up with their ambitious peers. </p>
          <p>Teaching is about empowerment and metacognitive thought. But the daily execution of this craft is done by holding students to standards far above their comfort zone. It’s done by a keeping a keen, real-time awareness of students’ comprehension and knowing how to scaffold content. The most impressive educators are those who paradoxically cultivate a sense of humility and with a sense of urgency consume every instructional strategy that may give them an advantage. </p>
